This is not a complete project, rather a quick prototype for an idea of a diagnostic
built with Typescript (and bundled with a node distribution).

Current project zip size with node distrubiton is 26.2 MB. This does not exclude any build / project items - so this likely can be cleaned up in a production scenario to create a smaller distribution, since the node distribution is 19.7 MB.

download a node distribution, and unzip. The unzipped folder should be within the root level of this probject. eg `./node-v12.16.1-darwin-x64`.
